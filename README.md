# External Resource Checker Extension

This is exactly the same as going to the website and manually checking the URL of a completion, however, it is now just an extension that you can pin. It should save a little bit more time.

## TODO

- [ ] Ensure compatability with Chrome and Firefox. Some images  may need to be updated.
- [ ] Look into Manifest v2 vs v3 since Chrome won't support v2 for much longer.
- [ ] Look into auto detecting as opposed to manually clicking the button.
